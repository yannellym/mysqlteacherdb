# mysqlteacherdb


With this project, I practiced using Python and MySQL Connector to create an entirely new database in MySQL Server, created tables within that database, defined the relationships between those tables, and populated them with data.

I also practiced how to Create, Read, Update and Delete data in the database.

I practiced extracting data from existing databases and loading them into pandas DataFrames in order to analyze it.
Lastly, I practiced taking the data generated by the Python scripts and applications, and write those into a database where they can be safely stored for later retrieval and manipulation.
